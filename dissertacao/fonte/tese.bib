  abstract = {The latest edition of this classic is updated with new problem sets
	and material The Second Edition of this fundamental textbook maintains
	the book's tradition of clear, thought-provoking instruction. Readers
	are provided once again with an instructive mix of mathematics, physics,
	statistics, and information theory. All the essential topics in information
	theory are covered in detail, including entropy, data compression,
	channel capacity, rate distortion, network information theory, and
	hypothesis testing. The authors provide readers with a solid understanding
	of the underlying theory and applications. Problem sets and a telegraphic
	summary at the end of each chapter further assist readers. The historical
	notes that follow each chapter recap the main points. The Second
	Edition features: Chapters reorganized to improve teaching 200 new
	problems New material on source coding, portfolio theory, and feedback
	capacity Updated references Now current and enhanced, the Second
	Edition of Elements of Information Theory remains the ideal textbook
	for upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses in electrical
	engineering, statistics, and telecommunications. An Instructor's
	Manual presenting detailed solutions to all the problems in the book
	is available from the Wiley editorial department.},
